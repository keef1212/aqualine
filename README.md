# Aqualine
Aqualine is a lightweight terminal communication program that uses TCP to ensure a connection from the client to server.<br />

Want to start your own server? Execute the server.py file on your machine, customise it, then connect to your server.<br />
**If you want your server to be accessible across networks, you need to manually edit the server.py file to run on the local IP address of your machine.**
