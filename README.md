# Aqualine
Aqualine is a terminal communications program that utilizes TCP to ensure a connection from the client to server.<br />
It currently only works on your LAN, but I am working to get it to work across networks.<br />
Please contribute to Aqualine as its currently in its infancy.<br />

Want to start your own server? Execute the server.py file on your machine, then, connect to the your server.
