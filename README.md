# Aqualine
Aqualine is a lightweight communication protocol. This repository comes with the base client and server programs. You may use the client provided if you wish, or modify and download third party clients at your will. Same goes for the server.<br />

Want to start your own server? Execute the server.py file on your machine, customise it, then connect to your server.<br />
**If you want your server to be accessible across networks, you need to manually edit the server.py file to run on the local IP address of your machine.**
